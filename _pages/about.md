I'm a first year PhD student at [Siebel School of Computing and Data Science](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/) in University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, currently working with [Prof. Charith Mendis](https://charithmendis.com/). 

Before joining UIUC, I completed my Bachelor's degree in School of [Electronics Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/xxkxjsxy/Home/HOME.htm) from Peking University in 2025. During my time there, I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xin Zhang](https://xinpl.github.io/index.html) for my thesis. Also, I feel fortunate to have collaborated with [Prof. Thomas W. Reps](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~reps/) from University of Wisconsin-Madison as a visiting student researcher in summer 2024.

My research interests lie in Compilers and Programming Languages, especially about the improvement of tensor compilers for machine learning. Feel free to drop me an email if you are interested about similar topics!
